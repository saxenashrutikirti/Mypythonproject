# Mypythonproject
A python script that collects the movie reviews for the top 50 movies from each
website : IMDB, Metacritics, and Rotten Tomatoes AND 
compares the top 50 movies that are considered top rated across the 3 websites. It then constructs a
dictionary that uses the movie name as the key, and their genre information as the value. For
example: dictionary = {Black panther: [Adventure, Action, Fantasy], Casablanca:[Drama]}
Using similar technique like word embedding, program shows the similarity score
between the genres of movies ranked as top 50 across these 3 websites.
