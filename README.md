# Cross Platform Movie Genre Analysis
This data analysis project aims to determine the most popular movie genres by aggregating genre information from three major movie review websites. The project involved 1) Using BeautifulSoup library (Python) to develop a framework which can scrape movie reviews from IMDB, Metacritic, and Rotten Tomatoes. 2) Collecting information on the top 50 movies from each website, including movie names and genre information. 3) Cleaning the collected data to ensure consistency and accuracy. 4) Creating 3 dictionaries for each website, mapping movie names to their respective genres. 5) Calculating similarity scores between movie genres across the three websites using cosine function and identifying the most popular genres by analyzing similarity scores and frequency distributions.
